# Project Origins
My desires to both gain web development experience and organize my book collection were the origins of this project. By adding books to the websites database, users can contribute information that has site-wide impact, all the while having their own personal experiences with the project.

# What It Needs to Run
Ensure you run both `pip install Django` and `pip install wikipedia`. Once the server is running go to `127.0.0.1:8000/books` in your browser.

# User Experience
As of right now there is no way to sign up for accounts. To do that, users must create the account on Django's admin site. However, once an account is made, users can favorite books, as well as curate personalized collections (sort of like playlists but for books). But, you do not need an account to take advantage of this site by adding books and accessing information.

# Features
* Add Books
* Favorite Books
* Book Collections
* Amazon Kindle Previews (on a book's page, click on the image)
* Book Details with About the Author populated automatically from Wikipedia.

# Tools Used
This project was made using Django -- Python, JS, HTML, CSS. The UI utilizes Semantic-UI CSS, which I highly recommend.
