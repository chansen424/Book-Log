# Project Origins
My desires to both gain web development experience and organize my book collection were the origins of this project. By adding books to the websites database, users can contribute information that has site-wide impact, all the while having their own personal experiences with the project.

# User Experience
As of right now there is no way to sign up for accounts. To do that, users must create the account on Django's admin site. However, once an account is made, users can favorite books, as well as curate personalized collections (sort of like playlists but for books).

# Tools Used
This project was made using Django -- Python, JS, HTML, CSS. The UI utilizes Semantic-UI CSS, which I highly recommend.
